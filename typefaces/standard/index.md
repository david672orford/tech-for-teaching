# Standard Typefaces on Personal Computers

## Three Basic Typefaces

While modern computer systems often have hundreds of fonts installed, they will
almost always have versions of the following typeface families:

* A proportional-width typeface with serifs, some version of
  [Times New Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman)
  which <i>The Times</i> of London commissioned from Monotype and started
  using in 1932. Times typefaces are commonly used for the body text
  of articles and books.
* A proportional-width typeface without serifs, similar to
  [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica Helvetica). Typefaces like
  this have traditionally used for signs. They may also be used sparingly in
  books to set off certain parts of the text such as chapter titles, captions
  to illustrations, or additional information in boxes. Today typefaces
  like Helvetica are also widely used in computer interaces to label the
  controls.
* A monospaced slab-serif similar to
  [Courier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)) of the IBM
  Selectric typewriter. Typefaces like this are used when it is desirable
  for the letters on a page to line up in rows and columns, such as when
  writing computer code, or where tradition demands that the printed document
  look like it was produced with a typewriter.

Each of these three typeface families will have at least four variants:
regular, bold, slanted (oblique or italic), and both bold and slanted.
In total, there are 12 fonts which should always be available to your
document no matter where it is displayed.

The typeface actually used may not look exactly the same as the one on
your computer, but it will be close and most importantly, the letters
will have the same width. This is important when the line breaks cannot
or should not be changed. This is particulary important in PDF documents
where each line break and frequently the placement of each letter are
fixed. In this case the substitution of a typeface with different letter
widths can be disastrous as letters run into one another or weird gaps
open which looks awful and even destroy legibility.

These four typeface families each in four variants are sufficient for
ordinary books and documents. You can safely assume that they are acceptable
substitutes will always be present. If you choose to use other typefaces,
you will either have to provided them to recipients of electronic
documents by embedding them or accept the fact that one of the typefaces
above may be automatically substituted.

Android devices are a notable exception to the above in that they do not
seem to have typefaces width-compatible with Times and Helvetica. In
particular Google Chrome for Android will simply provide the system
default serif font when asked for Times and the system default sans-serif
font when asked for Helvetica. This can occasionally cause problems because
Droid Serif is a bit wider than Times. This is particularly troublesome in
SVG illustrations were the right sides of lines of text can be cut off.

## Adobe PostScript Fonts

The precedent for computer typeface was set by the Apple Macintosh computer
and the LaserWriter printer which used the Adobe PostScript printer language.
Together they were widely used for desktop publishing.

The original LaserWriter and other printers with PostScript level 1 contained
these build in fonts:

* [Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman) (4 variants)
* [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica) (4 variants)
* [Courier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)) (4 variants)
* Symbol (1 variant, Greek letters and mathematical symbols)

Times and Helvetica were licensed from Linotype. Originally these
fonts included only the Latin alphabets of Western European languages.

Times is dignified and legible typeface which is widely used. However, the
later 35-font version of the PostScript set provides other choices which
are less ornate and even more legible.

The PDF standard defines a base set of fonts which include the origin 13 fonts
from Adobe PostScript plus Zapf Dingbats (see below).

For PostScript level 2 Adobe licensed 22 more typefaces:

* Helvetica (4 new narrow variants)
* New Century Schoolbook (4 variants) (is there an MS equivalent?)
* Palatino (4 variants)
* Bookman (4 variants)
* Avant Garde Gothic (4 variants)
* Zapf Chancery (1 variant, medium italic) (is there an MS equivalent?)
* Zapf Dingbats (1 variant, decorative elements)

New Century Schoolbook is a member of the
[Century family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_type_family)
of *very* readable typeface designed for
grammar school textbooks. [Palatino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino)
is considered a good typefaces for body text. Both are less ornate that
Times New Roman.

[Bookman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookman_(typeface)) or
Bookman Old Style is a serif typeface. It is most used at
large sizes in headings and at small sizes in advertising. It is
generaly not used for body text.

[Avant Garde Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Avant_Garde)
is a sans-serif typeface used in logos.

[Zaph Chancery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Zapf_Chancery)
is a script typeface (it looks like it was written
with a wedge-shaped pen.) Only the italic form is included.

It is usually safe to use any of the basic 35 PostScript fonts in your documents
and web pages. They are installed by default on devices from Apple. As explained
below, Linux and Microsoft Windows computers have substitutes which look very
similiar and have letters of the same width so the formatting of the document
should not change.

## The URW Fonts and GNU Freefont

The increasing standardization on the Postscript typefaces created a problem.
Indepently licensing a full set was difficult and expensive. This was
particularly a problem for users of Ghostscript, a free close of PostScript.
Since the software was distributed free-of-charge, its authors could
not license the now standard 35 fonts.

In 1996 [URW++ Design and Development Incorporated](http://www.urwpp.de/)
came to the rescue. They released as free software their own set of 35
fonts which were visually similiar to those which Adobe had licensed and
most importantly had been adjusted to have the same letter widths.

* Nimbus Roman No9 L = Times
* Nimbus Sans L = Helvetica
* Nimbus Mono L = Courier
* Standard Symbols L = Symbol
* Century Schoolbook L = New Century Schoolbook
* Palladio L = Palatino
* Gothic L = Avant Garde Gothic
* Bookman L = Bookman
* Chancery L = Zapf Chancery
* Dingbats = Zapf Dingbats

These are high-quality fonts from a respected foundary. URW decided to
offer them for free distribution because the bulk licensing of similar
fonts by Adobe and Apple had depressed their commerical value. The
company decided that they would be more valuable in mass free distribution
as a way of advertising the company name.

Like the PostScript fonts of the time they covered only Latin alphabets.
The three font families which coorespond to Times, Helvetica, and Courier
have since been expaneded and released as
[GNU FreeFont](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/):

* FreeSerif (4 variants, 10,537 symbols)
* FreeSans (4 variants, 6,272 symbols)
* FreeMono (4 variants, 4,178 symbols)

In 2016 URW released [new versions of their 35 fonts](https://github.com/URWTypeFoundry/Core_35/)
There is also a [package of these fonts](https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/urw-base35-fonts)
which includes tweaks and configuration files for Fontconfig (the Linux font manager).

## Microsoft's Compatible Fonts

Microsoft licensed typefaces from Monotype (the inventor of Times
New Roman) instead of Linotype. These typefaces were created
or adjusted so that each letter would have the same width as in
the PostScript fonts. That way either set of typefaces could
be used to display the document without reformatting it.

The fonts in Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 1992 were:

* Times New Roman: a special version adjusted to have the same
character widths as Linotype's Times licensed by Adobe and Apple.
* [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial): Monotype's answer
to Linotype's Helvetica. Has the same character widths.
* Courier New
* Symbol
* Wingdings

Because these fonts have the same widths as the PostScript fonts
and the URW fonts, they are very safe to use. If they are missing,
the equivalent font from another vendor will probably be 
substituted automatically.

In time Microsoft started distributing additional fonts compatible
with members of the standard set of 35 PostScript fonts:

* Book Antiqua: Monotype clone of Linotype's Palatino
* Palatino Linotype: expanded version of Linotype's Palatino produced for Microsoft
* Century Gothic: Monotype clone of ITC's Avant Garde
* Bookman Old Style: Monotype clone of ITC's Bookman

## Microsoft's New Fonts

In 1996 Microsoft released its
[Core Fonts for the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web).
These included the 14 fonts listed above plus:

* Andal√© Mono (1 variant, sans-serif)
* Arial Black (1 variant, a particulary bold version of Arial)
* Impact (very bold only, sans serif, very wide vertical strokes)
* Comic Sans MS (regular and bold, looks like comic book lettering)
* Georgia (4 variants, serif)
* Trebuchet MS (4 variants, sans-serif)
* Verdana (4 variants, sans-serif, wider than most)

Georgia and Verdana were produced at the same time by the same designers
as complementary serif and sans-serif typefaces.

Microsoft's intent in releasing the Core Fonts for the Web
was to expand the base set of typefaces which all web designers could use
and thereby make web typography less boring. They become very popular and
are used on numerous websites.

Since then two changes have reduced the relevance of the Core Fonts. One is
the prominence of Android devices on which they are not installed by default.
The second is that modern web browsers can download and display fonts
specified by the web designer. Microsoft's license
[does not allow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/font-faq#web)
you to use these fonts in that manner. (Though you may be able to
license them from the foundary for a fee.) There are many other fonts
available for use on websites for free as described in our article
about [Web Fonts](../webfonts/).

For more information on typefaces distributed with Microsoft Windows see Wikipedia's article
[List of typefaces included with Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Microsoft_Windows)
and Microsoft's article
[Fonts and supported products](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/).

Though Microsoft no longer distributes the Core Fonts for the Web
as a separate package, the license under which it released them allows
others to continue to distribute them as long as the files are not modified
in any way. They can be downloaded from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/corefonts/files/)
and other places. Before they can be used they must be extracted which requires
a program which can unpack Microsoft CAB files.

## Liberation Fonts and Derivatives

These fonts are metrically compatible with the PostScript and Microsoft
equivalents:

* Liberation Serif = Times = Times New Roman
* Liberation Sans = Helvetica = Arial
* Liberation Mono = Courier = Courier New

They were created by Ascender Corporation under the name Ascender. RedHat
arranged for them to be licensed under the GPL. Google later also licensed them for use
as the Chrome OS Core Fonts. Version 2.0 of the Liberation fonts is based on the version
licensed by Google.

[Liberastika](https://github.com/eugeneai/Liberastika-fonts) is a derivative of Liberation
Sans with the Cyrillic portion redesigned to look better. Metric compatibility of the
Cyrillic letters with Arial was deliberatly not preserved since in the opinion of those
who did the redesign this was necessary to produce a good-quality Cyrillic typeface.
