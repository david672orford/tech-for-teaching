## Typeface Concepts

A typeface is a set of letters for typesetting. Originally a font was a set
of metal type of a particular typeface in a particular size, but today
the terms are generally used interchangably.

### Typeface Families

Typefaces come in sets called families. The typefaces within a family will
share a common design of the letter shapes but differ from one another
in regular ways.

The similarities without the family likely include:

* Whether the letters all occupy the same width on the page, like on a type
writer, or whether they occupy only the space they need, like in a newspaper.
If they all occupy the same width, the typeface is <b>monospaced</b>.
If the 'W' takes more space than the 'i' or the 'l', then the typeface
is <b>proportionally spaced</b>.
* Whether the letters has <b>serifs</b>. Serifs are the little caps on the
ends of the long strokes of the typefaces used in books and newspapers.
* The length and width of the serifs, if present, in relationship to the
lengths and widths of the main strokes.
* The height of the lower-case letters in relationship to the upper-case
letters. This is known as the <b>x-height</b> because it is expressed
as the lower-case letter 'x'.
* Regular differences in widths of strokes, such as horizontal verses
vertical strokes or strokes along the two diagonals.

The regular variations include:

* Weight: light, medium, and dark variants are created by varying the width
of the strokes.
* Width: the family may include versions of the typeface which have been 
squeezed or stretched horizontally.
* Slant: The letters may be slanted a few degrees to the right. If they are
slanted without significantly altering their forms, they are said to be
<b>oblique</b>. If some of the strokes are curved to make the whole letter
appear rounder, then the typeface is said to be <b>italic</b>.
