## How to Create Illustrations

Even if you do not consider yourself an artist, there are techniques which you
can use to produce passable illustrations for your courses. Some of these will
be familiar from grammar school. Think how children create illustrations with
scissors, glue, and construction paper. They may then add lines with crayons.
They may also cut elements out of discarded magazines and add them to their
compositions.

You can use many of the same techniques with Inkscape. Start by drawing
simple things and elements you find an stock illustration sites. Learn
to modify these and create new elements like them.
