## Creating 3D Models and Animations

Eventually I hope to offer recommendations for creating 3D illustrations
for use in instruction. Since I have not figured how best to do this
myself yet, for now this is just my notes.

## Software For Creating VRML/X3D Scenes

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org) --
	Can import and export in X3D format
* [Art of Illusion](http://www.artofillusion.org) --
	Can export in VRML format
* [White Dune](http://wdune.ourproject.org/) --
	Attempt to run on version 1.956 on Ubuntu 20.04 failed.
* [Titania](https://github.com/create3000/titania/wiki) --
	Snap package works on Ubuntu 20.04. Seems to suffer from
	long pauses.

	Last release in 2019
* [X3DOM Component Editor](https://github.com/x3dom/component-editor) --
	Very basic web editor

### 3D Scenes, Animation, and Games in Web Browsers
* [X3DOM](https://www.x3dom.org/) --
	Javascript library for embedding X3D files in a webpage. X3D and its
	predecessor VRML are file formats for 3D scenes to be displayed in web
	browsers.
* [X\_ITE](https://github.com/create3000/x_ite/wiki) --
	Display X3D in a web browser
* [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) --
	Game platform with 3D animation
	<br>(Not yet evaluated.)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) --
	
* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) --
	Higher level layer over Three.js

## Animation Tutorials

	Techniques for telling a story with less animation
* [How to Make Animated Peeps](http://www.jaanga.com/2012/04/how-to-make-animated-peeps.html) --
