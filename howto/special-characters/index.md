## Entering Special Characters

Computer keyboards typically have just over 100 keys on them of which fewer
than 50 actually produce a letter, number, or symbol when pressed. In
constract, a modern computer font seldom contains fewer than 300 symbols and
many contain thousands. 

One reason modern fonts contain so many symbols is that they provide alphabets
for additional languages such as Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Russian.

This explosion of symbols has been facilitated by the widespread adoption of
Unicode which is an international standard which assigns a numeric code to each
of the world's tens of thousands of letters, numbers, and symbols.

### Switchable Keyboard Layouts

If you will be typing in a foreign language, you will need to load an appropriate
**keyboard map**.

A keyboard map is a table in your computer which tells it what letter, number,
or symbol is meant when any given key on your keyboard is pressed both with and 
without the **Shift**, **Control**, and **Alt** keys. If we change this
map we can redefine the meaning of keys on our keyboards and can type in a
foreign language which uses a different alphabet. This can be done in the
keyboard control panel of modern operating systems such as Microsoft Windows,
MacOS X and Linux.

Because computer language keywords, commands, web addresses, e-mail addresses,
and so much more are written in the Latin alphabet, user of other alphabets
need an easy way to switch keyboard maps. Often this is done by pressing
**Alt** and **Shift** at the same time, though this too can be changed.

Users who are not touch typists in both languages need a way to know which
key is which. In countries with non-Latin alphabets keyboards or sold with
the local alphabet printed below the Latin alphabet on the keycaps. One can
also buy sets of transparent stickers which can be applied to the keycaps
of a US English keyboard.

### Character Maps

Most operating systems have a **character map**. This is a grid which
displays all of the available characters. In Microsoft Windows this can
be found in the Start menu. In MacOS X it can be found in most applications
under **Special Characters** in the **Edit** menu.

To use the character map you scroll through it, find the characters you need,
and click or press a button to copy them to the clipboard. You then go
back to your application and paste them in.

When computers provided only a few hundred possible symbols, character maps
worked well, but now that they provide thousands, it can be nearly impossible
to find the needed symbol. If you know the name of the character you want,
you may be able to find it using the character map's search function, if it
has one.

### Web Searches

Another way to find the character you need it to search for it on the Internet.
There are numerous sites with tables of characters organized in varous ways.
You have a good chance of finding what you need.

Often it helps to include the word "unicode" in your search. For example a
search for "unicode dash" will bring up a selection of dashes of various lengths
from which to choose.

When you find the character you need, just copy it and paste it into your document.

### Useful Special Characters to Copy

When you find the special characters which you need for your courses, you
can save time in future by pasting them into a document or a web page.

Here is an example:

<table>
<tr><th>With Accents</th><td>А́ Е́ И́ О́ У́ Ы́ Э́ Ю́ Я́<br>а́ е́ и́ о́ у́ ы́ э́ ю́ я́</td></tr>
<tr><th>English Quote Marks</th><td>“ ” ‘ ’</td></tr>
<tr><th>Russian Quote Marks</th><td>« » „ “</td></tr>
<tr><th>Em Dash</th><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><th>Ellipsis</th><td>…</td></tr>
<tr><th>Arrows</th><td>🡐  🡒  🡑  🡓</td></tr>
<tr><th>Checkboxes</th><td>☐  ☑</td></tr>
<tr><th>Bullets</th><td>• ◦</td></tr>
<tr><th>Cyrillic letter yo</th><td>Ё ё</td></tr>
<tr><th>Pre-1917 Russian Letters</th><td>І і Ѣ ѣ Ѳ ѳ Ѵ ѵ</td></tr>
<tr><th>Numero Sign</th><td>№</td></tr>
</table>

### Alt Codes

Under Microsoft Windows you can enter any character by holding down **Alt**
and typing its Unicode number in decimal on the numeric keypad. The
character will appear when you release **Alt**. Note that this will
work only if **Numlock** is on.

### Keyboard Tricks on a Macintosh

On a Macintosh computer if you hold down a letter key a little menu will
pop up from which you can choose an accented version of that letter.

If you want to add an accute accent to a letter, there is a quicker way:
Hold down **Option**, press **e**, and the letter over which you wish
to place the accent. There are a number of other sequences like this.
