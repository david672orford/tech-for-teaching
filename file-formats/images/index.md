## Image Formats

Image files are used to store photographs, drawings, and scans of documents.
Computer image file formats can be divided into two basic groups: raster
formats and vector formats.

To understand the difference, imaging that you drew a picture on graph
paper and had to instruct someone over the phone to duplicate the picture
on a blank piece of graph paper. You would have to options: 1) You could
ask him to label the rows and columns and then tell him what color to make
each square, or 2) you could tell him what shapes to draw, how big to make them,
and where they should be placed on the grid. The first option is the way
raster images work: They describe a grid of dots. The second option is how
vector images work: they describe what shapes to draw and where.

Digital photographs are stored in raster format. If you scan a drawing done
on paper, or a page from a book, that is in effect a photograph and will be
in raster format too. Only drawings done on the computer will be in vector
format.

Images in raster format have one big disadvantage. If the size of the dots in
the file do not coorespond with the dots on the screen or printer used to
display it, then the image will be blurred. If the dots in the file are big
enough, then may even be visible.  Vector images do not suffer from this
problem because we can convert them to dots just before we display them when we
know how many dots we need and how big they are.

Another advantage of vector images is that they are easier to modify.  Shapes
and lines can be added, removed, altered, or moved much as one might add or
remove words, sentences, and paragraphs in a word processor.
