Software for creating course materials should be easy-to-use. You should not
have to spend years learning how to produces decent results. It should also
be readily available to all so that you can share what you produce with your
colleges who can then modify them for their needs. Finally it is best if your
work can be stored in widely accepted formats which you will be able to open
and use again for years.

There requirements are not easy to meet. Programs for creative endevors can
be very expensive. They often save your work in files which only they can open.
Sometimes the format of these files changes between versions making it hard
to open files you created only a few years ago.

We also know that our readers use a variety of computers. While Microsoft
Windows is widely used, Apple Macintosh computers are very popular in
education. A few, including your author use Linux. For these reason, we
try to only recommend programs which run well on all three platforms.
All of the programs recommended are available free-of-charge on the 
Internet from reputable web sites.
Finally, to the maximum extent possible we have chosen programs which either
save in industry-standard formats or can export to such formats.
