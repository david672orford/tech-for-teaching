## Unfinished Evaluations

These entries are here because, while I found these programs interesting,
I have not used them and do not have enough information about them.

### Web Development
* [TUI Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) text editor
* [JAVASCRIPT & CSS MARKDOWN EDITOR](https://www.cssscript.com/tag/markdown-editor/) text editor
* [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) some kind of framework based on Python

### Web Office Suites
* [Onlyoffice](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/docker/opensource/opensource-script-installation.aspx?_ga=2.171818464.1118353405.1597510942-615934063.1597510942)
* [Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/)

### Raster Graphics
* [MyPaint](http://mypaint.org/)

### Video
* [Natron](https://natrongithub.github.io/)

### 2D Animation
* [Wick Editor](https://www.wickeditor.com/) --
    A promising web application for creating animations. Can export the finished
	animation as a video file or as a player which draws the animation in real
	time to an HTML5 canvas.
* [Krita](https://krita.org/) --
	Krita has support for 2D animation drawn frame-by-frame. Can export to video.
* [Svg.svg](https://svgjs.com/) --
	Javascript library for adding animation to SVG drawings. You can make a drawing in
	Inkscape, put it on your web page, and then use this library to show and hide elements
	(including layers), move things around, scale and rotate, them, all at a time
	and speed you specify. Recommended for basic animation needs were a game platform
	would be overkill.
* [Synfig Studio](https://www.synfig.org/)
* [Pencil](https://www.pencil2d.org/)
* [TupiTube](http://www.tupitube.com/)
* [Glaxnimate](https://glaxnimate.mattbas.org/)
* [Enve](https://maurycyliebner.github.io/)

### Stop Motion Animation
* [qStopMotion](http://www.qstopmotion.org) --
	Program to take a series of photos using a camera connected to your
	computer and later assemble them into a video. Works with webcams
	and some SLR's.

### 2D Games with Sprite Animation in Web Browsers
* [Pixi](https://www.pixijs.com/) --
	This is a sprite renderer. A sprite is a 2D image which is moved around the
	screen in a video game. Think of the of the invaders, canon, and bullets
	in Space Invaders. To use Pixi you write Javascript code to load your
	sprite image and to move then around, changes their size, rotate them, etc.
	Pixi alone is sufficient for animation. If you want to make a game, you can
	use additional libraries (suggested in the documentation) to detect
	collisions, make sounds, and simulate physics, or you can use one of
	several game engines which incorporate Pixi while providing these functions.
    * [Learning Pixi](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi)
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) --
	Phaser is a complete system for creating games which run in a web browser.
	Games are created by writing code in Javascript, so a basic understanding
	of that language is required. Phaser 2 uses Pixi as the sprite renderer.
	Developement of Phaser 2 continues under the name Phaser CE. Phaser 3
	uses its own sprite renderer.	
* [Gdevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/) --
	Gdevelop is another system for 2D games run in a web browser. Like Phaser,
	it uses Pixi to render the sprites.	

### Audio Processing
* [Aeneas Forced Aligner](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas) --
	Given a recording of speech and a transcript, find the start and end
	time of each utterance. See also detailed instructions at
	[Sil.org](http://software.sil.org/downloads/r/readingappbuilder/Reading-App-Builder-07-Using-aeneas-for-Audio-Text-Synchronization.pdf).
