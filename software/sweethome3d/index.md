## Using Sweethome 3D

[Sweethome 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com) is an easy-to-use program for
creating 3D models of house interiors including walls, windows, door, and
furniture. Using it is a little like building using a toy construction set. If
you are a beginner needing to create an interior scene for an illustration,
building it with Sweethome 3D will be a lot easier and faster than drawing it
with a generic 3D editor such as [Art of Illusion](../aoi/) or
[Blender](https://www.blender.org).

Sweethome 3D is written in Java which means that it will run most anywhere.
It performs acceptably even on modest hardware.

The first step when creating a new scene is to draw the walls. This is
done by selecting the ? tool and clicking with the mouse. You can then
open the settings of each wall and set the color of the front and the
back or choose a repeated pattern. You can also enable a baseboard,
set its height and thickness, and set its color or pattern. With creative
use of this feature you can simulate wainscotting or walls tiled partway
up.

Windows and doors can be selected from a library of ready-made objects.
They are dragged into place and snap into the walls. You can edit their
properties to change size and color. Some of them have movable parts
so you can open and close them.

Furniture also comes from a library. The program comes with a small selection
of furniture models. (More are available for download.  If you are really
ambitious, you can made your own using a generic 3D editor such as
[Art of Illusion](../aoi/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org).

Finally you add light sources and render your scene. You can position
the virtual camera and render a high-quality image which will be
saved in PNG format.
