I created this site to share what I have learned about using computer
technology, especially opensource software to create classroom handouts,
videos, audio lessons, and instructional websites. It is about really
understanding how the technology works and how to use it.

This site is intended for an audiance which already has solid computer
skills. We assume you know how to create documents, organize your files,
and how to create a simple website.

<ul class="tiles">

<li><a href="howto/">How to Perform Common Tasks</a>
<br>
We freqently need to perform mundane tasks such as converting videos,
scaling down photographs, and finding broken links on our websites.
Here I collect proven solutions for my future reference and yours.
</li>

<li><a href="software/">Software Reviews</a>
<br>
The opensource software which I use, why I have chosen it, and tips
for using it in to create teaching materials.
</li>

<li><a href="stock-material/">Stock Material</a>
<br>
Large collections a photographs, drawings, audio recordings, and other
materials are available for free on the Internet, if you know where
to look.
</li>

<li><a href="file-formats/">Understanding File Formats</a>
<br>
Any creative product produced on a computer is likely to be saved in one
or more files. It is helpful to understand what each of the common file
formats is for and what kind of things can be saved in it.
</li>

<li><a href="typefaces/">Understanding Typefaces</a>
<br>
Have you ever opened a document someone sent you only to find that
the letters run together? Or is the text in the SVG illustrations
on your website too wide when displayed on mobile devices? You may
have a problem with missing typefaces. What typefaces are generally
available? How can we make sure they are used? What about embedding
typefaces? Here are the results of my research.
