I created this site to share what I am learning about using computer
technology, especially opensource software to create classroom handouts,
videos, audio lessons, and instructional websites. It is important to me
to really understand how these technologies work and to know now to use
them effectively.

This is a complicated subject with much to understand any many skills to
aquire. Writing on this site helps me to sort it all out in my mind and
understand what I have to do to make progress. If you would like to
join me in this journey, welcome!

<li><a href="typefaces/">Understanding Typefaces</a>
<br>
Have you ever opened a document someone sent you only to find that
the letters run together? Or is the text in the SVG illustrations
on your website too wide when displayed on mobile devices? You may
have a problem with missing typefaces. What typefaces are generally
available? How can we make sure they are used? What about embedding
typefaces? Here is what I learned.

<li><a href="illustration/">Creating Illustrations</a>
<br>
Some concepts are best presented visually. Even if you do not consider
yourself an artist, there are techniques which you can use to produce
passable illustrations for your courses.
