I created this site to share what I am learning about using computer
technology, especially opensource software to create classroom handouts,
videos, audio lessons, and instructional websites. It is important to me
to really understand how these technologies work and to know now to use
them effectively.

This is a complicated subject with much to understand any many skills to
aquire. Writing on this site helps me to sort it all out in my mind and
understand what I have to do to make progress. If you would like to
join me in this journey, welcome!

<li><a href="howto/">How to Perform Common Tasks</a>
<br>
We freqently need to perform mundane tasks such as converting videos,
scaling down photographs, and finding broken links on our websites.
Here I collect proven solutions for my future reference and yours.
</li>

<li><a href="software/">Software Reviews</a>
<br>
The opensource software which I use, why I have chosen it, and tips
for using it in to create teaching materials.
</li>

<li><a href="stock-material/">Stock Material</a>
<br>
Large collections a photographs, drawings, audio recordings, and other
materials are available for free on the Internet, if you know where
to look. Here are some of the sites which we have found useful.
</li>

<li><a href="file-formats/">Understanding File Formats</a>
<br>
Any creative product produced on a computer is likely to be saved in one
or more files. It is helpful to understand what each of the common file
formats is for and what kind of things can be saved in it.
</li>

<li><a href="typefaces/">Understanding Typefaces</a>
<br>
Have you ever opened a document someone sent you only to find that
the letters run together? Or is the text in the SVG illustrations
on your website too wide when displayed on mobile devices? You may
have a problem with missing typefaces. What typefaces are generally
available? How can we make sure they are used? What about embedding
typefaces? Here is what I learned.
</li>

<li><a href="illustration/">Creating Illustrations</a>
<br>
Some concepts are best presented visually. Even if you do not consider
yourself an artist, there are techniques which you can use to produce
passable illustrations for your courses.

<!--
<li><a href="3d-modeling/">Creating 3D Models and Animations</a> (stub)
<br>
In some cases the best way to present an idea is with a moving or interactive
illustration. I am exploring ways to do this and collecting notes here.

<li><a href="video/">Creating Videos</a> (stub)
<br>
Creating videos is easier than ever. You probably already have a camera which
can shoot video. With free software you can edit it, add caption and narration
to produce an instructional video.

<li><a href="photography/">Taking and Using Photographs</a> (stub)
<br>
Photographs can be used as illustrations or to make flash cards. Creating
high-quality photographs is easier than ever whether you are using a camera
or your phone.
