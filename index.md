On this site I share my experience using computer technology, especially
opensource software to create classroom handouts, videos, audio lessons,
and instructional websites. It is intended for an audiance which is already
comfortable using desktop computer software and already knows how to perform
computing tasks such as organizing files, creating documents, and
uploading materials to a website. This site is about taking things to the
next level.

## [Software Reviews](software/)
The opensource software which I use, why I have chosen it, and tips
for using it in to create teaching materials.

## [How to Perform Common Tasks](howto/)
We freqently need to perform mundane tasks such as converting videos,
scaling down photographs, and finding broken links on our websites.
Here I collect proven solutions for my future reference and yours.

## [Understanding Typefaces](typefaces/)
Have you ever opened a document someone sent you only to find that
the letters run together? Or is the text in the SVG illustrations
on your website too wide when displayed on mobile devices? You may
have a problem with missing typefaces. What typefaces are generally
available? How can we make sure they are used? What about embedding
typefaces? Here are the results of my research.

## [Stock Material](stock-material/)
Large collections a photographs, drawings, audio recordings, and other
materials are available for free on the Internet, if you know where
to look.
