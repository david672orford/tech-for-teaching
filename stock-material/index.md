## Stock Material for Lessons

The term **stock material** refers to representations such as drawings,
photographs, and video clips which are kept on hand for future use in
larger works such as articles and documentary films. For example if we
were writing a history lesson we might search for "stock" photographs
of the persons involved in the events described. If we were writing about
a concept such as "family" or "cooperation", there might be a stock photograph
or drawing to illustrate the idea.

### Legal Considerations

There are three basic ways to obtain stock material: 1) is to save
your own photographs and drawins which you think may be useful in the future,
2) to buy the material from a commercial service when you need it, and 3)
to obtain it from online collections.

If you choose option two or three, you should pay careful attention to the
legal terms, since they may limit how you can distribute the lessons which you
produce. For example, a license which prohibits commercial work may prevent you
from using the stock material in a textbook which is sold. Or the license may
require that you include a notice crediting the creatore of the stock material.
This will require extra work on your part.

Material which is in the public domain can be used freely with no restrictions
on modification and no requirement to name the source. Most material that is
in the public domain entered it because the copyright term expired.
Nowadays some material enters the public domain because the copyright holder
has waived all rights. This is frequently done using the
[CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

From the standpoint of one who wants to use stock material, the next best thing
to the public domain is a [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses).
That is because these licenses clearly spell out how you may use a work, including whether you may
modify it or incorporate it into your work, and any notices which you must provide.

Beware of sites with licenses written by amateurs. These are often vague, confusing,
contradicatory, and fail to cover common situations.

You should keep notes on where you obtained your stock material. A lawyer, Faye Gelb
provides [a good explanation](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-get-free-pictures-for-my-website/answer/Faye-Gelb).
